# DOM
`document` (DOM), `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `fetch` are not part of ECMAScript or JS spec.

#### To get the value of the sum without clicking the button, we use `oninput="sum()"` in the input tag. This will send a request every time you type something. See it in `index2.html`.

## Debouncing
Similar to the above, but it bounces. If you search anything on the Amazon search bar and type quickly, it will wait until you finish typing and then show you suggestions. This will reduce the requests sent to the backend. See it in `index3.html`.

```javascript
let timeout;

function debouncedSum() {
    // Delay the call to sum() until I've not been called for 100ms
    // and I've been called at least once
    clearTimeout(timeout); // To clear timeout
    timeout = setTimeout(function () {
        sum();
    }, 500); // 100ms
}
