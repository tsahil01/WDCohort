### 2. ToDo using DOM (Harkirat's code)
### 3. State: some data or object.

```javascript
function updateDomAccToState(state){
    const parent = document.getElementById("container")
    parent.innerHTML = ""
    for(let i=0; i<state.length; i++){
        const child = createChild(state[i].title, state[i].description, state[i].id)
        parent.appendChild(child)
    }
}

state = [{
    title: "Go to gym",
    description: "1 to 7 pm"
}]

updateDomAccToState(state)
```

In the above code, we can see that every time we call `updateDomAccToState()`, we pass in state data, which usually comes from the backend. By this, the parent `innerHTML` gets deleted, and then re-written. That is, we are first clearing the DOM and then we are adding more things to the DOM. This is not an optimal approach. We need something that can detect the old state and new state, and then change or add or delete the required data from the parent `innerHTML`. A better solution will be by calculating the `difference between the new state and old state` and not clearing the DOM, rather add/remove only the required part of DOM. This approach is used in React called as Virtual DOM.

You are correct in pointing out that the current implementation clears the entire `parent` `innerHTML` and then rebuilds it based on the provided state data. This approach can be inefficient and may lead to unnecessary re-rendering of the entire DOM.

To optimize the process and make it more efficient, you could consider using a virtual DOM or a more sophisticated DOM-diffing algorithm. These techniques allow you to update only the parts of the DOM that have changed, rather than clearing and re-rendering the entire content.

Popular libraries like React.js implement a virtual DOM to efficiently update the actual DOM with minimal changes. By comparing the old and new states, you can selectively update only the elements that have been added, removed, or modified.

Implementing such optimizations would involve keeping track of the previous state and performing a comparison with the new state to determine the minimal set of changes required. This can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of your application, especially when dealing with large sets of dynamic data.

In summary, your observation is correct, and using a more advanced DOM-diffing technique can help improve the efficiency of updating the DOM based on state changes.

### 5. React is used for calculating the difference of state. and React-DOM takes care of the DOM of the page
