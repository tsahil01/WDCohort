# Common hooks in react

# Side effect:
- Any operation that reaches outside the functional scope of React compoent.
- setTimeout, fetch, setInterval, DOM(document...)

# Hooks:
- React Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. Before the introduction of hooks, state and other React features were only available in class components. Hooks were introduced in React version 16.8 to provide a more expressive and flexible way to handle state and side effects in functional components.
- common hooks are => useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo, useRef, useContext

## 1. useState =>
- lets us describe the state of the app.
- When state updates, it triggers a re-render which finally results in DOM update.

## 2. useEffect =>
- allows us to perfom `side effects` in fuction components.
- Side effects are operations that can affect other components or cant be done during rendering, such as data fetching or manually changing the DOM in React components.
```jsx
useEffect(callbackFunc, [Dependency array]) // callbackFunc can be a fetch()
```
- Dependency array 
    - When should the callback fn run.
    - if empty `[]` then callback calls only one 
    - it takes input: state variable

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import './App.css'

function App() {
  const [selectedId, setId] = useState(1)
  return (
    <>
    <button onClick={()=>{
      setId(1);
    }}>1</button>

    <button onClick={()=>{
      setId(2);
    }}>2</button>

    <button onClick={()=>{
      setId(3);
    }}>3</button>

    <button onClick={()=>{
      setId(4);
    }}>4</button>

    <Todo id = {selectedId}></Todo>    
    </>
  )
}

function Todo({id}) {
  const [todo, setTodo] = useState({})

  useEffect( ()=>{
    fetch(`https://sum-server.100xdevs.com/todo?id=${id}`)
    .then(async function(response){
      const json = await response.json()
      setTodo(json.todo)
    })
  }, [id]);

  return <div>
    <h1>
      {todo.title}
    </h1>
    <h4>
      {todo.description}
    </h4>
  </div>
}

export default App

```


## 3. useMemo =>
- Memorization => It means remembering some output given an input and not computing it again.

- Problem:

![Alt text](image.png)

```jsx
import './App.css'
import { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState(1);


  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= inputValue; i++) { // expensive for loop
    count = count + i;
  }

  return <div>
    <input onChange={function(e) {
      setInputValue(e.target.value);
    }} placeholder={"Find sum from 1 to n"}></input>
    <br />
    Sum from 1 to {inputValue} is {count}
    <br />
    <button onClick={() => {
      setCounter(counter + 1);
    }}>Counter ({counter})</button>
  </div>
}

export default App;


// On clicking the btn it cause re-render of entire App component.
// Which means the expensive for loop runs again, which is not god.
```

- Solution: 

```jsx
import './App.css'
import { useMemo, useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState(1);


  let count = useMemo(() => { // this only runs when inputValue changes
    let finalCount = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= inputValue; i++) {
      finalCount = finalCount + i;
    }
    return finalCount;
  }, [inputValue])

  return <div>
    <input onChange={function(e) {
      setInputValue(e.target.value);
    }} placeholder={"Find sum from 1 to n"}></input>
    <br />
    Sum from 1 to {inputValue} is {count}
    <br />
    <button onClick={() => {
      setCounter(counter + 1);
    }}>Counter ({counter})</button>
  </div>
}

export default App;
```

## 4. useCallback =>
- Hook in React used to memoize function.
- (STUDY AGAIN)

React Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. Before the introduction of hooks, state and other React features were only available in class components. Hooks were introduced in React version 16.8 to provide a more expressive and flexible way to handle state and side effects in functional components.

The main reasons for introducing React Hooks are:

1. **Functional Components with State:**
   - Prior to hooks, if you wanted to manage state in a component, you had to use a class component. Hooks allow you to use state in functional components, making it easier to write and understand component logic.

2. **Code Reusability:**
   - Hooks promote code reusability by allowing you to extract and reuse stateful logic across multiple components. Custom hooks enable you to encapsulate and share logic such as fetching data, managing timers, etc.

3. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - With hooks, you can organize your code based on concerns rather than lifecycle methods. Each hook focuses on a specific aspect of the component's behavior, like managing state, handling side effects, or using context.

4. **Simpler and Cleaner Code:**
   - Hooks often lead to simpler and cleaner code compared to class components. Functional components with hooks are typically more concise and readable.

Commonly used React Hooks include:

- `useState`: Allows functional components to have local state.
- `useEffect`: Handles side effects in functional components (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions).
- `useContext`: Enables functional components to subscribe to React context without introducing nested components.
- `useReducer`: A more advanced state management hook that is useful for managing complex state logic.
- `useCallback` and `useMemo`: Memoization hooks to optimize performance by memoizing functions or values.

Here's an example of using `useState`:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, `useState` is a hook that allows `Counter` to maintain and update its state (`count`) in a functional component.
