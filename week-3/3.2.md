# The fetch API

1. fetch is part of js runtime. It was not originally in JS
2. fetch is promise.

```javascript
function getData(){
    fetch('https://fakerapi.it/api/v1/persons')
    .then(function(response){
    response.json() // this is async. So we need to add next .then() bcoz .then() will give data after resolving (i.e. after complete the async task)
    .then(function(finalData){
        console.log(finalData)
    })  
    });
}
```


# Authentication

2. Encryption => coverting the above complicated string to simple string using key. It is two way.
3. JSON Web Tokens => takes JSON and creates a tokens. Converts complex JSON to long string. this token is created whenever you sign in. `https://jwt.io/`
4. Local Storage => web tokens is stored here till I logout. (Present in Application section of console in browser)
