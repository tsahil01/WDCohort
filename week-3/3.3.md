# JWT

1. Example of cheque book.
 - MY CHEQUE BOOK = MY JSON WEB TOKEN

2. JWT is used to verify backend that it is only you who is siningin.
3. JWT are just like these cheques. There are issued by the backend when you sign in. Anyone can create something very similar, but the backend would reject it. If You loose the original jwt, then it is a problem! 
4. Generating JWT ====> very long string
5. Decoding JWT ====> input is string. output can be seen by anyone
6. Verifying JWT ====> input is string. output is only verify it by backend.

```javascript
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
const secret = "2323232323"; // only backend has this

// Generate==>

const value = {
  name: "sahil",
  accNo: 12334354535,
};

const token = jwt.sign(value, secret);
// this token has been generated using secret, and hence this token can only be verifide using this secret

console.log(token) // op => "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoic2FoaWwiLCJhY2NObyI6MTIzMzQzNTQ1MzUsImlhdCI6MTcwNDYzNDUzMX0.urWnnM5_ZzhlaA_ncTdCbnaG4vfllHBfYuQMmTfuSz4"


// Decoding==>>
// To decode (same as going to jwt.io)
const decode = jwt.decode(token)
// anyone can decode or see your value using the decoding the token using https://jwt.io/ 
// It is same as Person A says to person B that he can see person B cheque book and its sign.
// But person A doesnot know how the bank verifies the cheque. So he can get stuck.
// This the same as the 'secret' Only the backend knows the secret of verifying the token.


// Suppose I create a token using jwt(using my own secret) and my friend goes to jwt.io and see the details on that token.
// Now if he tries to verify my token using backend jwt with any other key(secret) the backend would not verify it and will give error.



// Verify ==>
const verifiedData = jwt.verify(token, secret)
console.log(verifiedData)

// jwt.verify(token, jwtPassword) // verify can throw exeception if token is incorrect. Use try catch
    try {
        jwt.verify(token, jwtPassword);
        ans =  true;
    } catch (error) {
        ans =  false;
    }
    return ans
```

Your explanation provides a good overview of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and how they are used for generating and verifying tokens in a backend system. Let's break down and comment on each section:

1. **Token Generation:**
   
   ```javascript
   const token = jwt.sign(value, secret);
   ```

   Here, you are using the `jsonwebtoken` library to sign a payload (`value`) with a secret key (`secret`). The resulting token is a string that represents the signed payload. This token can be sent to clients for authentication or other purposes.

2. **Token Decoding:**
   
   ```javascript
   // anyone can decode or see your value using the decoding the token using https://jwt.io/
   ```

   This comment correctly highlights that JWTs are not encrypted, and their content can be easily decoded by anyone who has the token. However, to verify the integrity of the token (ensure it has not been tampered with), the secret key is required.

3. **Analogy with Cheque Book:**
   
   ```javascript
   // It is the same as Person A says to person B that he can see person B's cheque book and its sign.
   // But person A does not know how the bank verifies the cheque. So he can get stuck.
   // This is the same as the 'secret.' Only the backend knows the secret of verifying the token.
   ```

   This analogy effectively illustrates the concept that knowing the content of the token (like seeing the signature on a cheque) doesn't allow someone to forge or verify it without knowing the secret (like the bank's verification process).

4. **Potential Security Issue:**
   
   ```javascript
   // Suppose I create a token using jwt (using my own secret) and my friend goes to jwt.io and sees the details of that token.
   // Now if he tries to verify my token using the backend jwt with any other key (secret), the backend would not verify it and will give an error.
   ```

   This section emphasizes the importance of keeping the secret key secure. If someone else obtains your token and tries to verify it with a different secret, the verification will fail. This underscores the need for secure key management.

5. **Token Verification:**
   
   ```javascript
   // Verify
   const verifiedData = jwt.verify(token, secret);
   console.log(verifiedData);
   ```

   Finally, you demonstrate the token verification process using the `verify` method from the `jsonwebtoken` library. This method takes the token and the secret key, and if the verification is successful, it returns the decoded payload.

In summary, your explanation is clear and provides a good understanding of how JWTs work and the importance of keeping the secret key secure for proper token verification.
