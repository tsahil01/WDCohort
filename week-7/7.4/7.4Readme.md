# Asynchronous data queries =>
- We can put async function in atom.
- For that we need to use selector as a default value in the atom
- we can call our async function inside this selector.
- here async fuction can be fetch() request for initializing the default value to the state
- one of the great advntage of this is that we get rid of useEffect for async function task like fetch...
```js
export const notifications = atom({
    key: "networkAtom",
    default: selector({
        key: "networkAtomSelector",
        get: async () => {
            const res = await axios.get('https://sum-server.100xdevs.com/notifications')
            return res.data
            
        }
    })
});
```
